- Difference between @material-ui/core/styles and @material-ui/styles packages
  - No need to install @material-ui/styles if core is already installed
- Hook, ~~Styled component, HoC~~
- Nesting Selectors
- Adapting based on props
- Overriding Styles - classes prop
- Can't rely on the generated class names -> they keep changing
- Can use the class names of Mui Components as they are always constant except in some specific cases
- Global Styling
- Theming
